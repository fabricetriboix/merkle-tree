Merkle Tree C++ implementation
==============================

The build system is based on cmake, version at least 3.1; so you
need to install that on your system

To build on Linux:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/fabricetriboix/merkle-tree.git
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../merkle-tree
$ make
$ make doc
$ make test
```
